This project contains the source code for the book **Essential C#** by Mark Michaelis (Addison-Wesley).

## Checkout the online resource that walks through all code samples in this repository at [EssentialCSharp.com](https://essentialcsharp.com)

## Sample Code Guide

Ensure one of the following frameworks is installed at the latest version.

- [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) (All) - This project is currently tested against .NET 8.0, 7.0, and 6.0.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) contains .NET Core to get up and running. Not to mention, it's a great IDE that makes it easy to get started.

### Download the Code

#### Local Copy  

Open a console and change the working directory to the desired project location.

```
git clone https://github.com/IntelliTect/EssentialCSharp.git
cd ./EssentialCSharp/
```

The source code is the most recently published edition of the book and this is the default branch following the clone command. However, you can switch to a different branch, v12.0 for example, with the command:

```
git checkout v12.0
```

### Build

**EssentialCSharp.sln** is the project's main solution, open this with Visual Studio and _Build All_.

 For those using the command line, build all the projects from the /EssentialCSharp/ directory with these commands:

```
dotnet restore EssentialCSharp.sln
dotnet build EssentialCSharp.sln
```

### Run

Navigate to an individual project in the /EssentialCSharp/src/(project)/ directory and run the code. The example below is for Chapter01 with the user entering _1.1_ to execute the listing number.

To run a listing you must run the the project that contains it. For example, to run Listing 1.1 you must navigate to Chapter01 in the
_Solution Explorer_ and set Chapter01 as the startup project. In Rider this can be done by locating the desired project in the _Explorer_ tab, right clicking on the project and clicking _run_.

```
$ cd ./src/Chapter01/
$ dotnet run
Enter the listing number to execute (e.g. For Listing 1.1 enter "1.1"): 1.1

## Testing

To run all the tests, run `dotnet test` on the command prompt in the EssentialCSharp solution directory on your local computer.
