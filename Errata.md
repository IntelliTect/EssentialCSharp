Benjamin Michaelis        | 4           | 180-181          | Replace `EventArgs` with `PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(Property))` in Leveraging the Null-Conditional Operator with Delegates
Zhou Jing | 3  | 110 | Replace `System.Value<T1>` with `System.ValueTuple<T1>` in "For completeness, the `System.ValueTuple<T1>` exists but will rarely be used, since the C# tuple syntax requires a minimum of two items."
